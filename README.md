    <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
    <p>  Several times throughout this semester I considered whether this was the career path was the one for me. This class was immensely challenging for me since I came in with no previous experience coding. In the beginning especially I was struggling to understand most of the basic concepts for most of the semester. However, near the end, I started understanding how to use it in more ways than instructed or shown. I learned, and figured out how to adapt to the problems I had rather than copying you or a guide. When you showed me how easy it was to figure out the problems I was having with assignments, I realized most of the problems were minor and could be easily solved be working it out rather than expecting everything to work and freaking out when it didn't. If I could go back, the only thing I would change is how much I used my brain. I thought this process would have been straight-forward and simple so I didn't think while I was working or learning. One of the only things I can think I did well was commit myself when I was struggling. If I couldn't figure out a problem, I would try for hours until I gave up and asked for help or looked up a fix. The feedback I got on my SpaceX project helped me optimize it a lot. I already planned on adding the JavaScript slide show, but the feedback I got helped me make everything more cohesive and included, everything flowed together better. I also learned how to appraise my own work with the outlook of someone simply examining my work, someone who didn't spend a lot of time on it, so it would seem more unimpressive and inspire me to add more. This course helped me realize that this line of work isn't easy and that it could take a lot of time to yield results on projects and my future. Because of the effort I'd have to put in, however, the result will be that much more gratifying.</p>
